# 🚀 Yılmaz Akın – C#/.NET Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This space highlights my learning journey and hands-on experience with C# and .NET. Each project here was created to apply and reinforce key software development concepts, including polymorphism, method design, operator overloading, and more.

## 📂 Notable Projects

### 🔸 C# Polymorphism Demo
- **Description**: A small-scale project exploring the fundamentals of polymorphism in C#. It uses interfaces and inheritance to showcase how different classes can share a contract while implementing behavior differently.
- **Focus**: Interfaces, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
- **Repo**: [Polymorphism Assignment Submission](https://github.com/YilmazAkinn/Polymorphism-Assignment-Submission)

---

### 🔸 Custom Operator Overloading
- **Description**: Demonstrates the use of overloaded equality operators (`==`, `!=`) within a C# class. This helps compare class objects based on logical identity rather than default reference comparison.
- **Focus**: Operator Overloading, Object Comparison, Equals & GetHashCode.
- **Repo**: [Operators Assignment Submission](https://github.com/YilmazAkinn/Operators-Assignment-Submission)

---

### 🔸 Method Design & Class Structure
- **Description**: This project focuses on creating clean and reusable code by using both static and instance methods. It’s an exercise in designing well-structured classes and modular logic.
- **Focus**: Methods, Static vs Instance, Code Organization.
- **Repo**: [Method Class Assignment Submission](https://github.com/YilmazAkinn/Method-Class-Assignment-Submission)

---

### 🔸 Portfolio Assignment
- **Description**: A final project tying together multiple programming concepts into a single cohesive solution. Demonstrates understanding of object-oriented programming and application architecture.
- **Focus**: Integration, Full Application Structure, C# Fundamentals.
- **Repo**: [Portfolio Assignment Submission](https://github.com/YilmazAkinn/Portfolio-Assignment-Submission)
